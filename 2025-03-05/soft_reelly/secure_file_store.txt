1. Secure File Storage
Non-public Directory: Store the PDF in a directory that isn’t directly accessible from the web (i.e., outside your public folder). This prevents someone from typing in the URL and getting the file without proper authorization.
2. Request Flow
User Request: When a logged-in client clicks the link, their browser sends a request to your backend.
Token Verification: The backend checks the request for a valid authorization token (this could be a session token or a JWT). This ensures the user is logged in and has the right permissions.
Controlled File Access: If the token is valid, your backend reads the PDF file from the secure storage and streams it to the user. If the token is missing or invalid, the backend denies access (e.g., returning a 403 Forbidden response).
3. Choosing a File Manager
Backend Framework Dependent: The “file manager” isn’t necessarily a separate software but part of your backend framework that handles file storage and retrieval.
For PHP (Laravel): The built-in Storage system (powered by Flysystem) is an excellent choice. It provides an abstraction layer over various storage systems (local, S3, etc.) and integrates well with middleware for checking authentication.
For Node.js: You might use middleware (like Passport for authentication) together with Node’s file system modules to securely read and serve files.
Other Frameworks: Many modern frameworks (such as Django for Python or ASP.NET) have similar mechanisms to securely store and serve files after authorization checks.
In Summary
The secure backend flow is:
Intercept Request: A secure route is set up that requires a valid token.
Authenticate User: The backend verifies the token.
Serve File: If authenticated, the backend uses its file manager (e.g., Laravel’s Flysystem, or your framework’s equivalent) to fetch and serve the PDF; otherwise, it blocks access.
Using these methods ensures that even if someone gets hold of the URL, they won’t be able to access the PDF without the proper credentials.
